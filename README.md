# Overview
I have been interested in the blockchain for awhile and I wanted to create something that was new and hopefully useful using the blockchain idea.

My software uses Kotlin, right now I have the basics of my software done. I can create blocks. I can mine the blocks to make sure that they are valid. I can also store data inside of the blocks and then pull them back out later using JSON strings. I can save the block chain to a file also using JSON and then load the file back in.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment
I used the Intellij editor along with a library
* the Kotlinx serialization library for it's JSON capabilities

# Useful Websites

* [Youtube video on building a blockchain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVqczFZr124&t=1s)

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Make it easier to submit new items to the block chain.
* Allow compilation of all the seperate data points of an item to one object
* Allow peer-to-peer connections so that it doesn't have to be hosted on one server
